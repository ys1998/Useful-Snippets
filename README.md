# Useful Snippets
## A collection of code-snippets, cheat-sheets and tools
Surfing the web has often exposed me to little-yet-significant hacks and scripts, which, although, were not important to me then, seemed to be so in the near future.

And that's when I decided to **create, collect and store** such snippets for making my (and others :wink:) programming-life a bit easier - and also for future reference.

The *collection* currently houses these snippets:

*   **Scripts**
    *   *[block](Scripts/block.md)* `[created]` : A bash script to block, manage and unblock websites for any browser from the terminal itself 
    *   *[install-opencv](Scripts/install-opencv.sh)* `[collected]` : A bash script to download, configure and install OpenCV and other dependencies for Ubuntu
    *	*[get-song](Scripts/get-song.py)* `[created]` : A Python script to download the specified song without any hassle. It has options for manual selection as well as auto download, apart from choosing between audio and video.	
    * *[get_song_data](Scripts/get_song_data.py)* `[created]` : A Python script to automatically fetch song metadata (along with Album Cover) from Gracenote's database and update the corresponding MP3 file
    
*   **Data Structures [C++]**
    *   *[BST](DS/bst)* `[created]` : C++ implementation of Binary Search Tree data structure with basic functionality
    *   *[SkipList](DS/SkipList)* `[created]` : C++ implementation of Skip List data structure with basic functionality

*   **CryptoSuite**
    *   *[bi-croot](CryptoSuite/bi-croot.rkt)* `[created]` : Racket script to find the cube root of very large integers by bisection method
    *   *[croot](CryptoSuite/croot.rkt)* `[created]` : Same as above, but using Newton's method
    *   *[crypto_math](CryptoSuite/crypto_math.py)* `[collected]` : A Python-file containing common Cryptography-related algorithms
    
*   **Linux [commands & info]**
    *   *[Basic git commands for beginners](Linux/basic_git_commands)* `[created]`
    *   *[Common sed scripts](Linux/sed_common_scripts.txt)* `[collected]`
    *   *[Vim cheat-sheet](Linux/Vim_commands.pdf)* `[collected]`
    *   *[Basic terminal commands for beginners](Linux/linux_commands.md)* `[collected]` `[modified]`
